" MACHINE LEARNING ASSISTED METHODOLOGY FOR MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION OF MALIGNANT BRAIN TUMORS "

Introduction:
Accurate classification of malignant brain tumors is vital for effective diagnosis and treatment planning but remains challenging due to tumor diversity and reliance on invasive, subjective biopsy methods. Existing approaches often focus on binary classification with limited features, leading to suboptimal results for multi-class tumor identification, especially given the complexity of MR imaging conditions. This project proposes a machine-learning-based method using MRI data, integrating advanced feature selection and algorithms like KNN, mSVM, and Neural Networks to enhance classification accuracy. The goal is to develop a non-invasive

STEPS TO IMPLENT THE PROJECT:
1. Download the follwoing data
2. Make sure to see if u have python installed 3.8.0 version
3. Check whether the input for each type of tumor is present or not
4. Then after checking run the python file
5. Use the follwoing command "python app.py"
6. by thsi step a cmf=d should pop and direct your screen towards chrome and show the webpage
7. click in select the input and place a sample photo
8. after that the model will check and tell the accuracy and describe the type of tumor with the details of the particular tumor
